# Reactive Reddit

Hate how awful the reddit ui is? Want to completely eliminate content from reddit you don't want to see? Prusing a specific subreddit for a particular topic? Introducing, Reactive Reddit!

This is a react-based reddit sub viewer, allowing for quick and easy filtering. Working primarily based off of browser-caching, this implementation works locally to create an always up-to-date view.

## Running
All you need to do to run the program is run `npm start`.
