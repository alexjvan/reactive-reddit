TODO
Looking at the TODOs in this repo, summarizing to narrow down items to work on:

Large Projects:
- Extra Content! Revamp settings, create a better display for stats + settings, individualize the 2 components, clear-button.
- Settings! Add global settings, grab-frequency, grab on adding sub, text-only/media-only, Sorting options
- Filters! New Filter Variables, custom filters.
- Pre-processed Posts! Save the react-only data for posts, enable Media caching.
-- Thinking ahead on this, would this mean I need seperate models for all the items that won't be processing things again?
-- Once again, thinking ahead. Maybe just save retrieved media?

One-off Items:
- Handle Grabber error codes. Figure out why they aren't being caught (add try/catch?)
- Figure out why duplicate posts are being grabbed. Why is the second filtering required in the grabber
- Snapshot the data to save to disk, "saves"
- On initial load, snapshot storage. Create way to restore initial session
- Add keywords to stats
- Stop grabber button

Performance-Based Items:
- Not constantly be saving data into storage during retrieval
- Save scroll position (I believe the main issue with current implementation is post-shifting. But not 100% sure how to fix yet)
- HTML Error Code for cached Media
- Save Validations

Bugs/Errors:
- Grabber multiple events at once
- SOMETIMES, crashing wipes all data?
--  With groups, this only wipes the CURRENT groups data???
